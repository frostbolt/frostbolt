I began to be interested in software development in my teens. At first I studied programming on my own, then I took courses and at the age of 16 I got my first real IT job. I worked full time during the summer holidays and part time after school. It's not that I had to work to survive, no, I just liked it.

Nowadays, I am a full-stack developer, dealing with both frontend and backend stuff. It's not just a job; I like the challenge of solving problems and keeping up with what's new in tech.

Outside of the programming world, you can catch me taking photos, engaging in political activism or both at the same time!

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk tech or just chat about anything else.
